# Abstract
Semi-supervised heterogeneous domain adaptation (SsHeDA) aims to train a classifier for the target domain, in which only unlabeled and a small number of labeled data are available. This is done by leveraging knowledge acquired from a heterogeneous source domain. From algorithmic perspectives, several methods have been proposed to solve the SsHeDA problem; yet there is still no theoretical foundation to explain the nature of the SsHeDA problem or to guide new and better solutions. Motivated by compatibility condition in semi-supervised probably approximately correct (PAC) theory, we explain the SsHeDA problem by proving its generalization error â€“ that is, why labeled heterogeneous source data and unlabeled target data help to reduce the target risk. Guided by our theory, we devise two algorithms as proof of concept. One, *kernel heterogeneous domain alignment* (KHDA), is a kernel-based algorithm; the other, *joint mean embedding alignment* (JMEA), is a neural network-based algorithm. When a dataset is small, KHDA's training time is less than JMEA's. When a dataset is large, JMEA is more accurate in the target domain. Comprehensive experiments with image/text classification tasks show KHDA to be the most accurate among all non-neural network baselines, and JMEA to be the most accurate among all baselines.

# Software version
Tensorflow (gpu) version is 1.14.0. Python version is 3.7.3. CUDA version is 11.2.

The main_J python requires some basic scientific computing python packages, e.g., numpy, sklearn and matplotlib. I recommend users to install python via Anaconda (python 3.7.3), which can be downloaded from https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/#download-section . If you have installed Anaconda, then you do not need to worry about these basic packages.

# Download data

Since Github does not allow big-size file (>25MB), we provide google-drive links of datasets we used in our paper (some are larger than 7GB):

After you download both data, you should run main_J.py successfully (remember to move data to the data folder, as decriped in add_dependencies.py). Hyperparameters are set in Line 145 of JEMME.py.

# For datasets provided,

run

```
python main_J.py
```

you can obtain the accuracy of JMEA.
